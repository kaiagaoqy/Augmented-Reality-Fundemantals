## 1. Points and Lines
### 1. Homogeneous Representation
- A line in the plane can be represented as follows
$$Line\ l : 0=ax+by+c, is\ written\ as\ (a,b,c)^T $$
- The point lies on the line:
$$Let\ x=(x,y)^T \ lies\ on\ l:(a,b,c)^T, if\ and\ only\ if\ ax+by+c=0$$
- To write such evaluation in dot product, we introduce homogeneous representation by adding the third dimension as one
$$(x,y,1)(a,b,c)^T=0$$
```ad-hint
The point $x$ lies on the line $l$ if and only if $x^Tl=0$
```
### 2. Cross Product and Intersection
Given two lines $l=(a_x,a_y,a_z)$ and $l'=(b_x,b_y,b_z)$, we want to find the intersection of these two lines.
$$x =l\times l'$$
First, we introduce the cross product, whose magnitude equals to the area in between the two given vectors, and direction is perpendicular to the $ll'$ plane.Therefore,
$$l^Tx={l'}^Tx=0$$
And we have proved that the point x lies on l if and only if $x^Tl=0$, therefore x is the point lies on both $l$ and $l'$

And keep in mind that **these three vectors start at the same original point**! Hence, if we view the vector $l\times l'$ as a point, x would be the intersection point.

x  can be represented as 
$$x = l\times l' = (c_x,c_y,c_z)^T=(c_x/c_z,c_y/c_z,1)$$

When $l$ and $l'$ start at the origin point (0,0,0), the Cross Product will end at:
-  $c_x = a_yb_z − a_zb_y$
-   $c_y = a_zb_x − a_xb_z$
-   $c_z = a_xb_y − a_yb_x$
$$

x=l\times l'=
\begin{vmatrix}
i & j & k \\
a_x & a_y & a_z \\
b_x & b_y & b_z \\
\end{vmatrix}
= (a_yb_z − a_zb_y)\vec{i}-(a_xb_z − a_zb_z)\vec{j}+(a_xb_y − a_yb_x)\vec{k}

$$


- And on the other hand, we can define the line passing through the two point with an analogous representation
$$l = x\times x'$$
Such that
$$l.x=l.x'=0$$
Which means both $x$ and $x'$ lies on line $l$,  because a line can be determined by two points
```ad-hint
The intersection of two lines $l$ and $l'$ is $x=l\times l'$

The line through two points $x$ and $x'$ is $l=x\times x'$
```
